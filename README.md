I've been grinding a lot of leetcode, so I wanted to make an effort to share some clean solutions I've created.
This is my own custom solution, and you won't find anything similar anywhere online.

This SQL Practice Projects retrieves the median burrito weight for end of the line cook supervisors (Sue and Dale).
What makes this solution so intresting, is if a median has an even number of values, the code automatically takes the average
number of the two middle values.
Example: The median for [1,2,3,4,5,6] isnâ€™t 3 or 4; the median is 3.5
