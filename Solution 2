SELECT
T.name, median(Buri.weight)
FROM burrito Buri
JOIN employees B ON Buri.Cooked_by_employee_id = B.id
JOIN employees M ON B.supervisor_id = M.id
JOIN employees T ON M.supervisor_id = T.id
GROUP BY cooked_by_employee_id;
By using object-oriented programming (like Python) you could add a recursive loop to
automatically accommodate infinite levels of managers :)
The pseudocode is:
x = cooked_by_chef_id
If( x != null){
Select row employee.id(x)
x = supervisor.id}
